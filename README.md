##Introduction

This project was created to be my portfolio. The goal was to create a React app that would showcase my previous projects, a little about me, and to showcase my talent with the portfolio itself. While building the app, I had the goal of researching and using new features. I like to have my designs tell a story. I used CSS animations to show an energetic dance of many small parts coming together to make a complex whole. I used the React Swiper package to make somthing that looked interesting, while showing the information in an easy to see and navigate way.
